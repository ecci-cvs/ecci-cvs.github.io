## OpenEP

<img src="/img/software-openep.png" style="width: 30%" />

OpenEP is an open-source platform, developed by our group, designed for the analysis of electrophysiology data. It provides a standardised (manufacturer-agnostic) format and reduces storage requirements by a two-fold order of magnitude. Hence, OpenEP provides a practical solution for the collection and storage of electrophysiological data recorded using different acquisition machines. OpenEP provides functions to extract valuable parameters from electrophysiology data.
