The Edinburgh Computational Cardiovascular Imaging (ECCI) research group aims to use advanced analysis of imaging and electrophysiology data to improve the understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cardiovascular disease.

The ECCI group, in the Centre for Cardiovascular Science at the University of Edinburgh, is jointly lead by Professor Michelle Williams and Dr Steven Williams, both British Heart Foundation-funded Intermediate Clinical Research Fellows. 

Our research involves multi-modality cardiovascular imaging, electroanatomical mapping, computational modelling, machine learning/artificial intelligence and ‘big data’ health data science. We are committed to cross-disciplinary working and open science research.
