## Research Fellow in Computational Cardiac Electrophysiology

![](/img/vision2.png)

We are currently recruiting to a bioengineering role. The post-holder will be responsible for conducting original research, focussing on the design, implementation, and evaluation of Computational Electrophysiology algorithms for analysing electrophysiology data at scale. In particular, the post-holder will join the ReCETT-AF clinical study team (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05057507) and the OpenEP project (https://openep.io) of clinical support tools in cardiac electrophysiology using computational modelling techniques for multimodal data integration and prediction of cardiac outcomes. 

## Post doctoral research assistant in cardiovascular imaging

Coming soon

We are recruiting to a post doctoral research assistant role. The post-holder will be responsible for conducting original research, focussing on developing and using machine learning techniques to identify markers of cardiovascular disease in large datasets of computed tomography images and using the combination of imaging and clinical information to better understand cardiovascular disease.
