title: Text to image generation of medical images
short: Text-to-image generation models have already transformed art and design industries. However, these models also contain latent medical information. In this paper we explored computed tomography image generation with the  DALL-E model (from OpenAI).

Text-to-image generation models have already transformed art and design industries. However, these models also contain latent medical information. In this paper we explored computed tomography image generation with the  DALL-E model (from OpenAI).
We created images from the simple free text input, such as “computed tomography of the heart with lots of colours”. The model was able to generate realistic three dimensional images of the heart, with some anatomical irregularities.
Text-to-image generation models have potential applications for education and model training. However, there are important issues to discuss, including trust, misrepresentation, plagiarism, and the potential for fraud in medical research.
