Unsupervised machine learning has the potential to identify new disease phenotypes through the use of cluster analysis. In this paper we used cluster analysis to demonstrate new phenotypic groups amongst patients with cardiovascular disease who underwent SPECT (Single-photon emission computed tomography) myocardial perfusion imaging. This work was performed along with our collaborators from Cedars Sinai Medical Centre, Los Angeles.

Cluster analysis is an unsupervised machine learning technique, which means that it does not require labeled data or predefined categories.Â The goal of cluster analysis is to identify natural groupings within the data set, such that objects within a group are more similar to each other than to objects in other groups. The resulting groups or clusters can provide insights into the structure of the data and can be used for further analysis or decision-making.

In this paper we identified 9,221 patients from the REFINE SPECT registry who had known coronary artery disease. We showed that cluster analysis could be used to identify three distinct groups of patients based on imaging and clinical characteristics. These groups also showed improved stratification for the risk of subsequent major adverse cardiovascular events compared to traditional SPECT metrics.
