Deep learning based language models have rapidly developed and now have the ability to produce human-like text covering a wide range of subject areas. However, these models also contain medical information. 

In this paper we asked ChatGPT (from OpenAI) it’s views on cardiovascular imaging. We asked it debate questions that will feature in the upcoming Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography
Annual Scientific Meeting, as well as how it though AI will transform cardiovascular imaging.

The model provided plausible responses to the debate questions about computed tomography imaging in acute chest pain, population screening for coronary artery disease and the assessment of high risk coronary artery plaques. Importantly it acknowledged the ongoing role of clinicians in patient care. 

Language models such as this have many potential uses. However, there are also important concerns and limitations to consider. This includes inaccuracies, attribution, lack of original thought, plagiarism, copyright, accountability, and biases.
